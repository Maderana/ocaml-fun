Error recovery is supported as follows: when the parser reaches an 
error state (no grammar rules can apply), it calls a function 
named parse_error with the string "syntax error" as argument. 

The default parse_error function does nothing and returns,

thus initiating error recovery (see below). 
The user can define a customized parse_error function in the 
header section of the grammar file.
