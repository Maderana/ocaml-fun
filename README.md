My attempts for the OCaml [course](https://www.france-universite-numerique-mooc.fr/courses/parisdiderot/56002/session01/about).

Disclaimer:

Since I did the exercises **after** the course ended, these have not been validated by the course grader. Use it at your own risk. You really shouldn't ideally be cheating, though.
