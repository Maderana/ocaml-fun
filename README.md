### Fun with OCaml

Some harmless fun with OCaml!

> Try to stop me, I wouldn’t care, I’d be ambivalent
> It’s the same game, behavioral equivalence
> And I don’t even think that you was all that
> Your scheduler was so lonely it couldn’t ever get a callback

> And really that’s the kind of thing that you couldn’t handle
> Because my double semicolons got them screaming OH CAML
> Side effects, catch them all, now you know we got ‘em
> All up in UTOP but I started on the bottom
